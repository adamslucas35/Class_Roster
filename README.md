SCENARIO
You are hired as a contractor to help a university migrate an existing student system to a new platform using C++ language.
Since the application already exists, its requirements exist as well, and they are outlined in the next section. 
You are responsible for implementing the part of the system based on these requirements. A list of data is provided as
part of these requirements. This part of the system is responsible for reading and manipulating the provided data.



You must write a program containing two classes (i.e., Student and Roster).
The program will maintain a current roster of students within a given course.
Student data for the program include student ID, first name, last name, email address, age, an array of the number of days to
complete each course, and degree program. This information can be found in the “studentData Table” below. 
The program will read a list of five students and use function calls to manipulate data. 
While parsing the list of data, the program should create student objects. The entire student list will be stored 
in one array of students called classRosterArray. Specific data-related output will be directed to the console.
